                    I am a solution driven software engineer looking to increase versatility through project
                    involvement. I possess full
                    stack experience in designing and implementing web-applications and have work experience in the
                    field of application
                    security.

                    Aside from my technical abilities, I am a very sociable person and love to stay active. I am a
                    strong believer in
                    putting everything you've got into everything you do. I enjoy picking up new skills, and polishing
                    existing skills to
                    become the best all-around person I can be.
